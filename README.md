## Motivation
💡 Learning Data Science is both exciting and overwhelming. Years ago, there were limited resources; today, there's an ocean of materials. Where should you start? 🤔

🌍 Many aspire to solve real-world problems using AI in industrial sectors. Unfortunately, most learning materials don't focus on practical industry applications.

## The Goal of the Roadmap
✔️ This roadmap is your **step-by-step guide** to becoming a solid **Junior+/Middle Data Scientist** from scratch! 🚀

### Who is this roadmap for?
✅ Beginners looking for a structured learning path 📚
✅ Data Scientists preparing for job changes or promotions 💼
✅ Engineers transitioning into Data Science 🛠️
✅ Those interested in **Industrial AI** 🏭

## READ THIS BEFORE YOU START
❗ **You will never feel completely "ready."** There's always more to learn in Python, Machine Learning, and Optimization. This roadmap will help you **build strong fundamentals** 💪

✔️ **If you're a beginner**: Start with Python + ML Basics and build a small project 💻
✔️ **If you have experience**: Pick topics where you need improvement 🔍

## Disclaimers
⚠️ No affiliations with recommended courses—these are **handpicked based on experience** 🔍
💰 Many resources are free, but some paid options provide better structure 🏆
💡 Coursera offers **financial aid**—I used it as a student! 🎓

## Roadmap Overview
📌 **Learning is a journey, not a sprint!**
✅ Start with **Python + ML Basics** ➡️ Build a project ➡️ Progress to **Advanced Topics & MLOps**
✅ If aiming for **Industrial AI**, complete the core ML topics first.
